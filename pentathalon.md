# Horace Phair XII Up-to-a-pentathalon!

The traditional greek pentathalon consisted of the javelin, a foot race, a discus throw, wrestling, and the long jump.

The Horace Phair XII Up-to-a-pentathalon consists of these nearly perfect replacements for the above events:

1. Midday Saturday (leave at 12ish?): An archery competition of hitting a target with 10 arrows.
  - Pizza box with circles drawn on it? 
  - Water balloons as bonus
  - This is going to be at Washington Park, so we'll need to coordinate rides with & for people who want to do this. 
2. Midafternoon Saturday (2:30pm or so?): 3 legged race at Irving Park
3. Midafternoon Saturday (3pm or so): A three-hole disc golf course at Irving Park
   - This is "hit that tree" style, so don't expect proper disc golf holes or anything
4. Saluthaus evening: Olive-oil thumb wrestling.
    - Contestants cover their thumb in olive oil
    - Score for the winner is opponent's hand size divided by contestant hand size
5. Saluthaus evening: A JS Joust competition
    - Only free-for-all games
    - Last man standing wins
	- 5 games are allowed
	- If there are ties after everyone's got their 5 games in, one final tiebreaker round is played

We are not all similarly abled and or talented or interested! So let's not make every event required. Taking part in an event will get you 1 HPXIIUTAP victory point. 1st, 2nd, 3rd get points as follows:

attendance: 1 HPXIIUTAPVP
third: 2 HPXIIUTAPVP
second: 4 HPXIIUTAPVP
first: 6 HPXIIUTAPVP
