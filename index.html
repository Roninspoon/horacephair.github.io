    <blockquote><p>O my friends etcetera
    Seriously? You were doubting that Columbus Day would come this year?
    You were doubting the Saluthaus would open up for you to celebrate
    this day of ambivalent origins and celebrated present?
    Please. Have some faith. This will be our seventh year.</p>
    
    <p>The U.S. holiday of Columbus Day falls on Monday, October 13. This is
    relevant to us because some places of work and study allow that as a
    day off, and this is a party that takes a whole weekend, sometimes
    plus. It's also somewhat unfortunate, because (every year) it's the
    Very Same Day as Canadian Thanksgiving, but i think that just means we
    need to make sure Rowan is well-fed.
    And perhaps give thanks. Give thanks for Canada! Ok, we'll do that.</p>

    <blockquote><p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus_Day_Storm_of_1962">Columbus Day Storm of 1962</a> 
    (otherwise known as the Big Blow) was an extratropical wave cyclone that ranked among the most 
    intense to strike the United States Pacific Northwest since at least 1948, likely since the 
    January 9, 1880, "Great Gale" and snowstorm. On a larger scale, the Columbus Day Storm of 1962 is 
    a contender for the title of most powerful extratropical cyclone recorded in the U.S. in the 20th 
    century; with respect to wind velocity, it is unmatched by the March 1993 "Storm of the Century" 
    and the "1991 Halloween Nor’easter" (aka "The Perfect Storm"). In the eastern United States, only 
    hurricanes of Category 3 or higher have brought winds of the magnitude witnessed in Oregon and 
    Washington on Columbus Day, October 12, 1962.</p></blockquote>
