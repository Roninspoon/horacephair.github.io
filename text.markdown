> Friends of Saluthaus:
> 
> The U.S. holiday of Columbus Day falls on Monday, October 13. This is
> relevant to us because some places of work and study allow that as a
> day off, and this is a party that takes a whole weekend, sometimes
> plus. It is relevant to us because we are taking part in a great tradition of our people. This will be the seventh year of said great tradition. 
>
> It will happen largely at 4407 NE 8th Ave. Some will inevitably spill out into the rest of Portland, because we are generous and tipsy and like to explore. Our interns have helpfully stocked the map above with some relevant geographically-tied data. They've also stocked the plan below with some relevant time-related data.

>Contribute to the success of this campaign! Bring <a href="#reading">literature</a> and consider a <a href="#saucing">sauce contribution</a> for Saturday night. Feel free to tip the bands. Treat our neighbors as you would like them to treat us.

#<a name="singing"></a>Singing
Bring Rise Up Singing if you have it. Bring your ocarina, your ukelele, your zither. If you went home with a copy of our songbook, bring that back. We'll make more, though.

#<a name="reading"></a>100% literacy or deth
THIS YEAR'S READINGS: Real estate listings. Sell us a bridge, if you must.

Maybe that wasn't clear. Have you <em>looked</em> at real estate prose? Whether it's selling a missile silo, a haunted irish villa, or an "interesting" fixer with lots of "charm and potential" in a "colorful" neighborhood... we're sure you can find or create something worth reading.

#<a name="saucing"></a>A sauce in every pot
No pie party this year. Sorry guys. Instead, SAUCE PARTY.<br />
Like last year, Friend Jack will be leading an intrepid and daring team in an industrial-scale pasta production operation. But <em>this time</em> the sauces are pot luck. If you have a signature sauce you want to contribute, or just a darn good marinara, and you need a cookin' venue, ask us.<br />
Saluthaus basil garden is up for pillaging. There may well be some late-season tomatoes to use, too.

#<a name="moving"></a>The wheels on the bus
Trimet buses are great and they go where you want to go, more or less. You can check <a href="http://trimet.org">trimet.org</a> for the important information and trip planning.

Also, there are a few loaner bikes that will be available. We don't have spare helmets, though, so if you value your noggin, maybe you can pack one?

> The [Columbus Day Storm of 1962](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus_Day_Storm_of_1962) 
> (otherwise known as the Big Blow) was an extratropical wave cyclone that ranked among the most 
> intense to strike the United States Pacific Northwest since at least 1948, likely since the 
> January 9, 1880, "Great Gale" and snowstorm. On a larger scale, the Columbus Day Storm of 1962 is 
> a contender for the title of most powerful extratropical cyclone recorded in the U.S. in the 20th 
> century; with respect to wind velocity, it is unmatched by the March 1993 "Storm of the Century" 
> and the "1991 Halloween Nor’easter" (aka "The Perfect Storm"). In the eastern United States, only 
> hurricanes of Category 3 or higher have brought winds of the magnitude witnessed in Oregon and 
> Washington on Columbus Day, October 12, 1962.
