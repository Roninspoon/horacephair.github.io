#<a name="singing"></a>Singing
Bring Rise Up Singing if you have it. Bring your ocarina, your ukelele, your zither. If you went home with a copy of our songbook, bring that back. We'll make more, though.

#<a name="reading"></a>Reading
THIS YEAR'S READINGS: Real estate listings. Sell us a bridge, if you must.

#<a name="saucing"></a>Saucing
No pie party this year. Sorry guys. Instead, SAUCE PARTY.<br />
Like last year, Friend Jack will be leading an intrepid and daring team in an industrial-scale pasta production operation. But <em>this time</em> the sauces are pot luck. If you have a signature sauce you want to contribute, or just a darn good marinara, and you need a cookin' venue, ask us.

> The [Columbus Day Storm of 1962](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus_Day_Storm_of_1962) 
> (otherwise known as the Big Blow) was an extratropical wave cyclone that ranked among the most 
> intense to strike the United States Pacific Northwest since at least 1948, likely since the 
> January 9, 1880, "Great Gale" and snowstorm. On a larger scale, the Columbus Day Storm of 1962 is 
> a contender for the title of most powerful extratropical cyclone recorded in the U.S. in the 20th 
> century; with respect to wind velocity, it is unmatched by the March 1993 "Storm of the Century" 
> and the "1991 Halloween Nor’easter" (aka "The Perfect Storm"). In the eastern United States, only 
> hurricanes of Category 3 or higher have brought winds of the magnitude witnessed in Oregon and
