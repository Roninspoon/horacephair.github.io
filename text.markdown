> Friends of Horace Phair:

> The U.S. holiday of Columbus Day falls on Monday, October 11 in 2010 C.E. This is relevant to us because some places of work and study allow that as a day off, and this is a party that takes a whole weekend, sometimes plus. It is relevant to us because we are taking part in a great tradition of our people. This will be the ninth year of said great tradition. 

> We're older now, maybe not wiser, maybe not even more mindful of the injuries and ailments (both physical and psychical) that come with years and recommend greater temperance in one's behavior. Not this weekend, anyway.

> Saluthaus got a facelift, though. And a butt job. And a vastly improved kitchen, for which I am currently hard-pressed to think of any crass anatomical/plastic surgery metaphors. Anyway, it looks nice. 

> Feel free to tip the bands. Treat our neighbors as you would like them to treat us. Oh, and it's HPIX. Bring your camera.

Other events from our affiliates:

* Weekendlong: <BR>
<a href="http://www.portlandnursery.com/events/appletasting.shtml">Apple tasting</a> at Portland Nursery. Where to find Laurel, if you want to see her this weekend. Many many apples, pears, asian pears; cider, strudel, bands, etcetera.
* <a href="http://www.wordstockfestival.com/"><b>Wordstock Festival</b></a> Readers include Joey Comeau and...some other people I forgot. (Kristin Hersh and Jonathan Lethem both read at 3 PM Sat. Not together, sadly. Admission to the whole deal is $7)

#<a name="brunch"></a>Brunch
In case you didn't know, Portland is a brunch town. Especially if you have a hangover. The <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?hl=en&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=Portland,+Oregon&source=embed&msa=0&msid=116469707736573020051.00045795ab44f482df768&ll=45.557018,-122.656141&spn=0.273568,0.441513&z=11">map</a> has locations of some nearby favorites -- the general recommendation is to wake up, make yourself as decent as you want to be, grab a couple of eating companions and go! There is often a line, and finding seating for more than five or six might push your brunch into solid lunchtimes, especially on a Saturday. (And there's usually coffee available to people in line, just so you know.)

#<a name="spaghetti feed"></a>Spaghetti feed
Friend Jack, our Seattle-est HP organizer, will be pulling together a spaghetti feed this year for our chomp chomp glomp nump yum pleasure. Please feel free to contribute to the spread on Saturday evening, dinnertime (the Salut kitchen will probably be mostly in use, so if you need a kitchen for cookin' up your specialty, please ask and you will be directed to a friendly host kitchen).

#<a name="moving"></a>The wheels on the bus
Trimet buses are great and they go where you want to go, more or less. You can check <a href="http://trimet.org">trimet.org</a> for the important information and trip planning.

Also, there are a few loaner bikes that will be available. We don't have spare helmets, though, so if you value your noggin, maybe you can pack one? (Renting from a local bike shop - say Citybikes - is also an option!)

> The [Columbus Day Storm of 1962](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus_Day_Storm_of_1962) 
> (otherwise known as the Big Blow) was an extratropical wave cyclone that ranked among the most 
> intense to strike the United States Pacific Northwest since at least 1948, likely since the 
> January 9, 1880, "Great Gale" and snowstorm. On a larger scale, the Columbus Day Storm of 1962 is 
> a contender for the title of most powerful extratropical cyclone recorded in the U.S. in the 20th 
> century; with respect to wind velocity, it is unmatched by the March 1993 "Storm of the Century" 
> and the "1991 Halloween Nor’easter" (aka "The Perfect Storm"). In the eastern United States, only 
> hurricanes of Category 3 or higher have brought winds of the magnitude witnessed in Oregon and 
> Washington on Columbus Day, October 12, 1962.
