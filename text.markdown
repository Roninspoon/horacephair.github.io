It will happen largely at 4407 NE 8th Ave. Some will inevitably spill out into the rest of Portland, because we are generous and tipsy and like to explore.

#<a name="singing"></a>Singing
Bring Rise Up Singing if you have it. Bring your ocarina, your ukelele, your zither. If you went home with a copy of our songbook, bring that back. We'll make more, though.

#<a name="reading"></a>100% literacy or deth
THIS YEAR'S READINGS: Real estate listings. Sell us a bridge, if you must.

Maybe that wasn't clear. Have you <em>looked</em> at real estate prose? Whether it's selling a missile silo, a haunted irish villa, or an interesting fixer in a colorful neighborhood... I'm sure you can find or create 

#<a name="saucing"></a>A sauce in every pot
No pie party this year. Sorry guys. Instead, SAUCE PARTY.<br />
Like last year, Friend Jack will be leading an intrepid and daring team in an industrial-scale pasta production operation. But <em>this time</em> the sauces are pot luck. If you have a signature sauce you want to contribute, or just a darn good marinara, and you need a cookin' venue, ask us.<br />
Saluthaus basil garden is up for pillaging. There may well be some late-season tomatoes to use, too.

#<a name="moving"></a>The wheels on the bus
Trimet buses are great and they go where you want to go, more or less. You can check <a href="http://trimet.org">trimet.org</a> for the important information and trip planning.
