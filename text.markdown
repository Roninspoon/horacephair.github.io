> Friends of Horace Phair:

> The U.S. holiday of Columbus Day falls on Monday, October 12 in 2009 C.E. This is relevant to us because some places of work and study allow that as a day off, and this is a party that takes a whole weekend, sometimes plus. It is relevant to us because we are taking part in a great tradition of our people. This will be the eighth year of said great tradition. 

> It will happen largely at 4407 NE 8th Ave. Some will inevitably spill out into the rest of Portland, because we are generous and tipsy and like to explore. Our interns have helpfully stocked the map above with some relevant geographically-tied data. Eventually, they may rouse themselves to stock the plan below with some relevant time-related data. 

>Details will be forthcoming, as soon as we make them up. It's not like parties grow on trees, you know. Feel free to tip the bands. Treat our neighbors as you would like them to treat us.

#<a name="toasting"></a>Toasting
There is some disagreement and many good and distinct ideas about how this will work. Basically, the idea is that an arbitrary couple of people will be chosen and their relationship toasted. Other details will be worked out later. Come prepared to extemporize. There will be beverages for toasting and loosening your toasting tongue.

Not <em>that</em> loose, guys! Geez!

#<a name="brunch"></a>Brunch
In case you didn't know, Portland is a brunch town. Especially if you have a hangover. The <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=116469707736573020051.00045795ab44f482df768&amp;ll=45.557018,-122.656141&amp;spn=0.003906,0.003541&amp;source=embed">map</a> has locations of some nearby favorites -- the general recommendation is to wake up, make yourself as decent as you want to be, grab a couple of eating companions and go! There is often a line, and finding seating for more than five or six might push your brunch into solid lunchtimes, especially on a Saturday. (And there's usually coffee available to people in line, just so you know.)

#<a name="lifedrawing"></a>Life drawing
The Friends of Stephen Gordon ladies' literature and drawing society invites you to join them in a session of life drawing with a variety of models on Saturday afternoon, in the basement of the Saladhaus. If you would like to join, please bring your drawing implements (or let us know, we have a certain amount available to borrow). We share modeling duties, but no one is required to model if they're not comfortable with it.

#<a name="burrito bar"></a>Burrito bar
Friend Jack, our Seattle-est HP organizer, will be pulling together a burrito bar this year for our chomp chomp glomp nump yum pleasure. Please feel free to contribute to the spread on Saturday evening, dinnertime (the Salut kitchen will probably be mostly in use, so if you need a kitchen for cookin' up your specialty, please ask and you will be directed to a friendly host kitchen).

#<a name="singing"></a>Singing
Bring Rise Up Singing if you have it. Bring your ocarina, your ukelele, your zither. If you went home with a copy of our songbook, bring that back. We'll make more, though.

#<a name="moving"></a>The wheels on the bus
Trimet buses are great and they go where you want to go, more or less. You can check <a href="http://trimet.org">trimet.org</a> for the important information and trip planning.

Also, there are a few loaner bikes that will be available. We don't have spare helmets, though, so if you value your noggin, maybe you can pack one?

> The [Columbus Day Storm of 1962](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus_Day_Storm_of_1962) 
> (otherwise known as the Big Blow) was an extratropical wave cyclone that ranked among the most 
> intense to strike the United States Pacific Northwest since at least 1948, likely since the 
> January 9, 1880, "Great Gale" and snowstorm. On a larger scale, the Columbus Day Storm of 1962 is 
> a contender for the title of most powerful extratropical cyclone recorded in the U.S. in the 20th

> and the "1991 Halloween Nor’easter" (aka "The Perfect Storm"). In the eastern United States, only
