> The [Columbus Day Storm of 1962](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus_Day_Storm_of_1962) 
> (otherwise known as the Big Blow) was an extratropical wave cyclone that ranked among the most 
> intense to strike the United States Pacific Northwest since at least 1948, likely since the 
> January 9, 1880, "Great Gale" and snowstorm. On a larger scale, the Columbus Day Storm of 1962 is 
> a contender for the title of most powerful extratropical cyclone recorded in the U.S. in the 20th 
> century; with respect to wind velocity, it is unmatched by the March 1993 "Storm of the Century" 
> and the "1991 Halloween Nor’easter" (aka "The Perfect Storm"). In the eastern United States, only 
> hurricanes of Category 3 or higher have brought winds of the magnitude witnessed in Oregon and 
> Washington on Columbus Day, October 12, 1962.
