> The U.S. holiday of Columbus Day falls on Monday, October 10 in 2011 C.E. This is relevant to us because some places of work and study allow that as a day off, and this is a party that takes a whole weekend, sometimes plus. It is relevant to us because we are taking part in a great tradition of our people. This will be the tenth year of said great tradition. If you have to ask what people...

> We're older now, maybe not wiser, maybe not even more mindful of the injuries and ailments (both physical and psychical) that come with years and might recommend greater temperance in one's behavior. Not this weekend, anyway.

> But try these behaviors: Feel free to tip the bands. Treat our neighbors as you would like them to treat us. And hug the people who like hugs. It'll make you feel better.

#<a name="brunch"></a>Brunch
In case you didn't know, Portland is a brunch town. Especially if you have a hangover. The <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?hl=en&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=Portland,+Oregon&source=embed&msa=0&msid=116469707736573020051.00045795ab44f482df768&ll=45.557018,-122.656141&spn=0.273568,0.441513&z=11">map</a> has locations of some nearby favorites -- the general recommendation is to wake up, make yourself as decent as you want to be, grab a couple of eating companions and go! There is often a line, and finding seating for more than five or six might push your brunch into solid lunchtimes, especially on a Saturday. (And there's usually coffee available to people in line, just so you know.)

This is Portland, so it's ok to go to brunch in your pyjamas. Just tell them you're with us.

#<a name="spaghetti feed"></a>Spaghetti feed
Do we do a spaghetti feed this year? Or something else?

#<a name="moving"></a>The wheels on the bus
Trimet buses are great and they go where you want to go, more or less. You can check <a href="http://trimet.org">trimet.org</a> for the important information and trip planning.

Also, there are a few loaner bikes that will be available. We don't have spare helmets, though, so if you value your noggin, maybe you can pack one? (Renting from a local bike shop - say Citybikes - is also an option!)

> The [Columbus Day Storm of 1962](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus_Day_Storm_of_1962) 
> (otherwise known as the Big Blow) was an extratropical wave cyclone that ranked among the most 
> intense to strike the United States Pacific Northwest since at least 1948, likely since the 
> January 9, 1880, "Great Gale" and snowstorm. On a larger scale, the Columbus Day Storm of 1962 is 
> a contender for the title of most powerful extratropical cyclone recorded in the U.S. in the 20th 
> century; with respect to wind velocity, it is unmatched by the March 1993 "Storm of the Century" 
> and the "1991 Halloween Norï¿½easter" (aka "The Perfect Storm"). In the eastern United States, only
